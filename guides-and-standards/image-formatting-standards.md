# Image Format Recommendations for WordPress Content

When it comes to uploading images to WordPress, it's essential to consider the optimal resolutions to ensure clear and crisp visuals. Here are some guidelines:

## Image File Size Guidelines

* No matter what resolution or file format you use, the final image file size should be around 100Kb (kilobytes) or less.
* For large, featured, or full-screen images 300 - 500Kb is acceptable
* Any image larger than 500Kb is problematic and over 1MB (megabyte) is a significant error with major negative impact to page load time.

## Image Resolution Guidelines

1. **Minimum Resolution:** 1024 x 768 pixels (minimum) for a good starting point.
2. **Recommended Resolution:** 1280 x 1080 pixels or higher for best image quality.
3. **Maximum Width:** 1920 pixels or less, depending on the layout and display device.

## Image Aspect Ratios

1. **Portrait-Oriented Images:** 9:16 (e.g., 1080 x 1920) or 4:5 (e.g., 1280 x 1624)
2. **Landscape-Oriented Images:** 16:9 (e.g., 1440 x 2560)

## Image File Formats

1. **JPEG**: Best for most photographic images, as it provides excellent compression and quality.
   1. In general, a <mark style="background-color:yellow;">70% quality setting is a good balance between quality and file size</mark>.
   2. 40-60% quality setting will further reduce file size and may still look great, depending on the subject of the photograph. Experiment and see what gets the best results with a tiny file size!
2. **PNG**: Use for transparent or complex images that require a wider color gamut, like illustrations or graphics.
3. **WebP**: Consider using WebP for modern browsers that support it, offering better compression and smaller file sizes.

## Recommended Tools

* [XnConvert](https://www.xnview.com/en/xnconvert/) is a powerful, relatively easy to use image conversion and optimization tool, freely available for educational use on Mac, Windows, and Linux.
* [Yoga Image Optimizer](https://yoga.flozz.org/) is a simple and effective, open-source (free) image optimizer available for Mac, Windows, and Linux
* [Upscayl](https://upscayl.org/) - If for some reason you need to UPSCALE an image, this open-source (free) tool is one of the best we have seen. Available for Mac, Windows, and Linux.
